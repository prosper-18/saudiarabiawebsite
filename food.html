                Saudi Arabian cuisine (Arabic: المطبخ العربي السعودي) varies according to the diverse landscapes and regions of the country. The environmental, geographic, 
                and cultural diversity within this vast area has led to a wide variety of dishes. Saudi Arabia encompasses different regions, resulting in cuisines from the Central 
                region, Eastern, Southern and Western regions. Furthermore, Saudi Arabia's position along global trade routes has led to the introduction of various spices.Cooking 
                in Saudi Arabia is influenced by their native Arabian culture and the Islamic culture. Dates, for example, are associated with the tradition of
                 breaking the fast after Ramadan. Most food ingredients, such as wheat, dates, ghee, meat, fish and vegetables, are sourced locally. Through these ingredients, 
                 dozens of delicious dishes have been created, which are closely linked to Saudi Arabian customs and traditions. These dishes are typically enjoyed during festive 
                 seasons, Hajj, special occasions, weddings, and the arrival of a newborn. Serving these dishes to guests is a way of expressing generosity and the renowned 
                 hospitality of the people of Saudi Arabia.
                 Considered by many as the national dish of Saudi Arabia, Kabsa is a flavorful mixed rice dish typically made with basmati rice, meat, vegetables, and a blend of spices. 
                 Its variations from region to region underline the country's diverse culinary landscape and the adaptability of its cuisine. With its deeply aromatic flavors and hearty 
                 combination of ingredients, Kabsa embodies Saudi Arabia's love for spice-infused,   satisfying meals.
